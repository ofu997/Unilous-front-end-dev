<p>
A site where someone can find others with similar interests and skills with the purpose of getting them to work together on such projects
</p>
<h2>Plan</h2>
<p>
A site where a visitor can browse to find anyone planning to work on projects that he is interested in.
 
Project posts will require both a description on the project and a list of technologies along with the manpower each the project will demand. The user then has the option to add additional content like pictures, videos, code, and reference links.

A visitor can also create a profile that can be filled out through through api with a resume site like linkedin.com or indeed.com where their skills interests and brief description can be posted, all of this information on the user can also be browsed for alongside posts in the main search bar.

If a user is interested in working on a project they can request to work with them with a message and a proposition including information of what skills he offers manpower towards. He can also request to work with another user by sending them a message directly.
