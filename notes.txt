Errors & Warnings
    Render methods should be a pure function of props and state; triggering nested component updates from render is not allowed. If necessary, trigger nested updates in componentDidUpdate.
        to remove this error is to place the PieNav within the Slice page component
            the reason is because to reload the currentSlice when the broweser back arrow is hit the NavBar is not changed only the Slice therefore the Slice changes the currentSlice with again reloads the NavBar
    MongoNetworkError: failed to connect to server [cluster0-shard-00-00-dlwek.mongodb.net:27017] on first connect [MongoNetworkError: connection 5 to cluster0-shard-00-00-dlwek.mongodb.net:27017 closed]
        to remove this error make sure the ip addresses whitelist are configured correctly on the database service

Future notes
    before you lose your mind (if you can afford it) start from 0
    reduce to smaller components untill it works as intended
    if something has been triple checked and it does not make sense dont be spiritual and assume an impossible problem instead console log every detail to ensure it all as expected
    if css is buggy it might have to do with the rendering of the page in my case it had to do with the apollo hooks loading
    make sure to consider all the things a variable could be referring to in an error message
    if something is not updating properly it likely can be fixed with useEffect
